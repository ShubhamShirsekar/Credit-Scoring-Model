# Credit-Scoring-Model
A credit scoring model to predict the accuracy of the calculated credit score.
A credit scoring model is a tool that is typically used in the decision-making process of accepting 
or rejecting a loan. A credit scoring model is the result of a statistical model which, based on
information about the borrower (e.g. age, number of previous loans, etc.), allows one to
distinguish between "good" and "bad" loans and give an estimate of the probability of default. A
credit score is a number between 300â€“850 that depicts a consumer's creditworthiness. The higher
the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders. A credit score is based on credit
history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, and repayment history, and other factors.
Lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a
timely manner. Quantifying the risk involved in lending is one of the crucial steps. Nowadays
even a single person's financial history consists of many things and hence it has become
unfeasible to simply calculate a credit score while looking at a person's income tax returns or
other transaction history. Without the help of big data technologies one may never get a
comprehensive overview of a borrower's financial capability to return a loan. Big data
technologies can handle the large amount of data generated from one's financial history and
further analysis can be done on that data to refine and calculate a credit score. Machine learning
models can be trained and tested on datasets to automate and further refine this process and
automate it. Credit score has become a vital part of an individual's life or even for a business
without one it is often difficult to find a good line of credit and one may have no choice but to
accept a loan with unreasonably high interest rate. From the borrower's perspective it helps them
to open up avenues for credit that may not be available without a credit score. Then they can
make an informed decision with all the information in front of them.
